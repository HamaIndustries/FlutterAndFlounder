## Showcase

SHOWCASE VIDEO HERE

## FlounderFests
Start a FlounderFest using a Prismarine Diamond, a special diamond encased with prismarine. Once a FlounderFests starts, you and nearby players will have 100 seconds to kill as many boss fish as possible. Be careful, however, as you have a quota to meet. You must kill a minimum amount of boss fish for the event to continue, otherwise things won't turn out well for you... You must win 3 waves before you are considered victorious.

### Quota
The quota is the minimum amount of boss fish you need to defeat before the time is up.
Once the timer is up, should you and fellow players have met quota, the next wave with a higher quota begins. The quota will scale depending on the amount of players nearby.

### Frogmobile
The Frogmobile is the ultimate reward. It is crafted using Prismarine Pearls, which are gathered by playing FlounderFests. Obtaining Prismarine Pearls is very strict, requiring you to do very well in a FlounderFest. For the best chances of getting some, making it to wave 3 is pretty much required.

The Frogmobile moves very fast, and even has a jetpack! You can enable the jetpack by jumping like you would on a horse. The strength of the jump doesn't do anything.

### Other Rewards
Beyond the Frogmobile, there are other rewards which aren't nearly as strict. They are the following.

## Fun Facts
This mod pulls a lot of inspiration from various sources. I figured I would provide credit to them so you can check them out as well!  

This entire mod's core gameplay mechanics are heavily inspired by Splatoon 3's Salmon Run gamemode. It is a lot of fun, very chaotic, and overall a very well-designed gamemode.

The term "FlounderFest" comes from a Mario Kart Wii YouTube series by the same name, "FlounderFest"! It is one of my favorite YouTube series, and I have lots of fun memories watching it. Unfortunately, it ended a few years ago, but there are over 2 years of unique content to watch if you want to check it out!
